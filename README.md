Android game - Raja Rani Chor Police

Chits: Four chits entitled "Raja - the King", "Rani - the Queen", "Chor - the thief" and "Police - the Police or Commander-in-Chief".

The game upon throwing chits will assign the above roles to our players. The Player who comes out to be a Police has the job of catching the "Chor - thief" meaning the Police will guess from among the rest three people as who might be the "Chor". If the Police catches the thief he is awarded 500 points and if the police do not catch the thief - the thief runs taking away 500 points. 

The King and Queen are awarded 1000 and 800 points respectively.
